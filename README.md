## Additional Setup Steps

In case you need to perform additional setup, here are further commands you might find useful:

### 4. Installing Prisma Client

**Command:**

```bash
npm install @prisma/client
```

**Description:**

This command installs the Prisma Client npm package in your project, which allows you to interact with your database using Prisma ORM.

### 5. Installing Prisma CLI as a Dev Dependency

**Command:**

```bash
npm install prisma --save-dev
```

**Description:**

Installs the Prisma CLI as a development dependency, which provides a suite of commands to help you work with your Prisma schema and database.

### 6. Logging Out of Pscale

**Command:**

```bash
pscale auth logout
```

**Description:**

This command logs you out of the Pscale CLI tool, helping to secure your Pscale account by ending the current session.

### 7. Logging In to Pscale

**Command:**

```bash
pscale auth login
```

**Description:**

Use this command to log back into the Pscale CLI tool. This is required to perform various operations using Pscale, such as creating new database branches.

### 8. Creating a New Branch in Pscale

**Command:**

```bash
pscale branch create digifabv2 dev
```

**Description:**

This command creates a new branch named `dev` in the `digifabv2` project in Pscale. Branching allows you to create isolated environments to develop and test your database changes without affecting the main production database.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To set up your development environment, follow these steps:

### 1. Connecting to the Database

**Command:**

```sh
pscale connect digifabv2 --port 3309
```

**Description:**

This command is used to connect to the `digifabv2` database through port 3309 using `pscale`. `Pscale` is a tool that helps in connecting to your database easily.

### 2. Launching Prisma Studio

**Command:**

```sh
npx prisma studio
```

**Description:**

This command launches Prisma Studio, a visual editor for your database. It allows you to view and edit your database schema and data in a more user-friendly interface compared to traditional SQL editors.

### 3. Starting the Development Server

**Command:**

```sh
npm run dev
```

**Description:**

By running this command, you initiate the development server. This command is usually found in the `package.json` file of your project and is used to start your application in a development mode.

### 4. Updating the Database

**Command:**

```sh
npx prisma db push
```

**Description:**

If you need to update your database schema according to the changes made in your Prisma schema file, use this command. It pushes the new changes to the database, synchronizing it with your current schema without losing any data.

### 5. Executing the Database Dump

This section will cover the exact steps to execute the database dump, including command lines and options.

Command Line
An example of the command line to use for creating a database dump, e.g.,

```sh
pscale database dump digifabv2 main
```

## Uplaod to Github

Absolutely, I can guide you step by step to upload your latest changes to GitHub. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### Step 1: Stage Your Changes

First, you need to stage the changes that you want to commit. Use the following command to add all the changes to the staging area:

```sh
git add .
```

### Step 2: Commit Your Changes

Next, commit the staged changes with a meaningful commit message:

```sh
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

### Step 3: Pull the Latest Changes from the Remote Repository

Before you push your changes, it's good practice to pull the latest changes from the remote repository to avoid any conflicts:

```sh
git remote -v
git pull origin main
```

In this command, replace `main` with the name of the branch you are working on if it's not `main`.

### Step 4: Resolve Any Conflicts

If there were any changes in the remote repository, and if any of those changes conflict with your changes, you'll need to resolve the conflicts at this stage. Open the conflicting files and resolve the conflicts, then add and commit the resolved files:

```sh
git add <conflicting-file>
git commit
```

### Step 5: Push Your Changes to the Remote Repository

Finally, push your changes to the remote repository:

```sh
git push origin main
```

Again, replace `main` with the name of your branch if it's not `main`.

This command will upload your changes to the GitHub repository. If you're prompted for authentication, remember to use your GitHub username and a personal access token (not your GitHub password).

Please try these steps and let me know if you encounter any issues or if there's anything else you'd like assistance with.

You can check the URL of the remote repository associated with your local repository by using the `git remote` command in your terminal. Here's how you do it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project's directory using the `cd` command (if not already there).
3. Run the following command to see the URLs of all the remote repositories:

   ```sh
   git remote -v
   ```

This command will output the URLs of the remote repositories along with their names. Usually, the remote repository named "origin" is the primary repository for your project.

Here's an example output:

```sh
origin  https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git (push)
```

In this output, the URL of the "origin" remote repository is "https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git". This URL is what you use to interact with the remote repository over HTTPS.
